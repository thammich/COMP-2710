## 🤓 Assignment overview and learning outcomes 

In this assignment, we are going to apply what we have been learning. We will be working with a multi-class/struct program that consists of multiple files. You will need to create your own makefile to compile them so that your program will run on the jenkins server.  🚀

## 📝 Instructions

You can find the full instructions in multi-class-purchase-app.pdf. Remember that your program **MUST** output something on the jenkins server in order to receive **ANY** credit at all. See the instructions for more details on what your program should do and for a look at an example output.
